Agriculture plays a crucial role in the global economy, but plant diseases can severely affect 
crop yield, leading to financial losses. Traditional methods of disease detection rely on 
manual observation, which is slow, error-prone, and not scalable. 
This project aims to develop a real-time plant disease detection system using a deep 
learning-based CNN model that continuously monitors plants and classifies detected 
diseases.
